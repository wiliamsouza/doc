Vmware Image
============

I already have a Vmware Installation, will this VM run on it?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Our Vmware Image is running Vmware hardware level 4 (formerly generation 4),
thus should run on most Vmware installation.

.. note:: #TODO: Migrate and link here.

However this kind of VM can't be run on Vmware ESX 3.0+. If your are planning
to use our demo image on such an installation, you will have to convert it
using Vmware Converter. For more information please read this document 
(PDF, 1.2 MB).
