Imaging
=======

Is my computer supported by the imaging module?
-----------------------------------------------

We support latest x86 (32 and 64 bits) computers. We will often update thei
imaging client to support more hardware.

Which filesystems are supported?
--------------------------------

.. note:: TODO: Migrate and link here.

See ImagingSupportedFileSystems.

My filesystem is not supported. What can I do?
----------------------------------------------

Pulse 2 features a raw backup mode, which works with all filesystems. Beware
that the resulting image size will not be optimized.
