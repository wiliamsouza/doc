General
=======

I administer computers running various operating systems (Windows, Linux, Unix). What help can I get from Pulse 2?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mandriva Pulse 2 help you roll-out Windows or GNU/Linux operating systems to
workstations and servers. Pulse 2 maintains a software and hardware inventory
of each computer in its database. All software installed in the profile may be
automatically updated, including security updates. Thanks to bandwidth
management mechanisms and a modular architecture, Pulse 2 fits the needs of
multi-site IT infrastructures.

Can Pulse 2 help me industrialize my desktop roll-out and IT management processes?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mandriva Pulse 2 performs identical installations and updates while reducing
the workload of the computer teams. Administrators using both Mandriva Pulse
and Directory Server will be able to easily manage the rights of users and to
assign them profiles that will be activated when connecting to general-purpose
workstations.

How many computers can Pulse 2 administer?
------------------------------------------

Pulse 2 was designed to administer up to tens of thousands of desktops or
servers.

Is Pulse 2 easy to incorporate into a network?
----------------------------------------------

Pulse 2 is genuinely easy to implement in a corporate network thanks to its
modularity and the use of standards. Pulse 2 additionally integrates with other
tools like OCS Inventory, GLPI. Nagios is also possible.

Where can I found some deployment script examples?
